# Welcome my Github

Hello, my name on the web is FPSensor (previously known as GKart).    
I am a development enthusiast and spend part of my spare time developing on Android.    
I live in Argentina. my birthday is 16 - 12.    

Supported devices:

**Xiaomi Mi 8 aka dipper**    

¡¡¡¡I don´t maintain public builds for any device for now!!!!

Also i have a Moto G3, Redmi 4X that i can`t unlock, a old LG F60 and a Huawei P8 Lite.
But these are useless

if You want me to add another device to this list u have two options:
1. Send me the device or money to buy it [Donation]
2. Wait to see if i add the device [So I buy the device myself]
